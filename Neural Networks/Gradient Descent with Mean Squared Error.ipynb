    "You might think there will be three input units, but we actually need to transform the data first. The `rank` feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode `rank`, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n",

    "We'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train. Instead, if we standardize the data, we can initialize the weights easily and everyone is happy.\n",

To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, mm to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001.
